    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview"> The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to
      describe the security functionality of operating systems in terms of <cite linkend="bibCC"/>
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products.
      An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software
      resources, and provides common services for application programs. The hardware
      it manages may be physical or virtual.

			enterprise on the operating system. This administrator could be
			acting remotely through a management server, from which the system
			receives configuration policies.  An administrator can enforce
			settings on the system which cannot be overridden by

      <subsection title="TOE Boundary" id="TOEboundary">
        The TOE boundary encompasses the OS kernel and its drivers, common
        software libraries, and some application software from the OS vendor. The applications considered within the TOE
        are those that provide essential security services, many of which run with elevated
        privileges.  Applications which are covered by more-specific Protection Profiles cannot 
        claim evaluation as part of the OS evaluation, even when it is necessary to evaluate 
        some of their functionality as it relates to their role as part of the OS.

      <subsection title="TOE Platform" id="TOEplatform">
	The TOE platform, which consists of the physical or virtual hardware on which the TOE executes,
        is outside the scope of evaluation.  At the same time, the security of the TOE relies upon it.
        Other hardware components which independently run their own software and are
        relevant to overall system security are also outside the scope of evaluation.

    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">Requirements in this Protection Profile are designed to
      address the security problems in the following use cases. These use cases are intentionally
      very broad, as many specific use cases exist for an operating system. These use cases may also
      overlap with one another.  An operating system's functionality may even be effectively extended by
      privileged applications installed onto it.  However, these are out of scope of this PP. <usecases>
        <usecase title="End User Devices" id="enduserdevices">
          <description>
	    The OS provides a platform to end user devices such as desktops,
	    laptops, convertibles, and tablets. 
	    These devices may optionally be bound to a directory server or management server.
            As this Protection Profile does not fully address the data-at-rest problem,  
            enterprises deploying mobile devices should ensure that these systems
            include data-at-rest protection evaluted against other Protection Profiles.

                inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and OS id fields.
                <br/> If the OS does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator will
                obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret. <br/> The
                evaluator will verify the correctness of the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme
                by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive
                the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.
                <br/> If key confirmation is supported, the OS shall perform the above for each
                implemented approved MAC algorithm. <br/>
                <b>Validity Test</b><p/> The Validity test verifies the ability of the OS to
                recognize another party’s valid and invalid key agreement results with or without
                key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator will obtain a list of the
                supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A key agreement
                implementation to determine which errors the OS should be able to recognize. The
                evaluator generates a set of 30 test vectors consisting of data
                sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator’s
                public keys, the OS’s public/private key pairs, MAC tag, and any inputs used in the
                KDF, such as the other info and OS id fields. <br/> The evaluator will inject an
                error in some of the test vectors to test that the OS recognizes invalid key
                agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret
                value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MAC'd, or the
                generated MAC tag. If the OS contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key
                validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties’
                static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the OS’s static private
                key to assure the OS detects errors in the public key validation function and/or
                the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors
                shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
                (they should pass). <br/> The OS shall use these modified test vectors to emulate
                the key agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator will
                compare the OS’s results with the results using a known good implementation
                verifying that the OS detects these errors. <br/>
              </indent>
              <b>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</b><p/> The evaluator will verify that the TSS
              describes whether the OS acts as a sender, a recipient, or both for RSA-based key
              establishment schemes. <br/> If the OS acts as a sender, the following assurance
              activity shall be performed to ensure the proper operation of every OS supported
              combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <br/>
              <indent> To conduct this test the evaluator will generate or obtain test vectors from
                a known good implementation of the OS's supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation
                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector
                shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional
                input parameters if applicable, the MAC key and MAC tag if key confirmation is
                incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator
                shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the OS with the same
                inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the MAC
                key from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MAC key used in normal
                operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext
                in the test vector. </indent>
              <br/> If the OS acts as a receiver, the following assurance activities shall be
              performed to ensure the proper operation of every OS supported combination of
              RSA-based key establishment scheme: <br/>
              <indent> To conduct this test the evaluator will generate or obtain test vectors from
                a known good implementation of the OS's supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
                confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key
                confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
                KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
                vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material, any
                additional input parameters if applicable, the MAC tag in cases where key
                confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector,
                the evaluator will perform the key establishment decryption operation on the OS
                and ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material is equivalent to the
                plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
                incorporated, the evaluator will perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
                the outputted MAC tag is equivalent to the MAC tag in the test vector. </indent>
              <br/> The evaluator will ensure that the TSS describes how the OS handles decryption
              errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the OS must not reveal
              the particular error that occurred, either through the contents of any outputted or
              logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP is supported, the
              evaluator will create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of the
              three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B section
              7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure that any
              outputted or logged error message is identical for each. If KTS-KEM-KWS is supported,
              the evaluator will create separate contrived ciphertext values that trigger each of
              the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special Publication 800-56B
              section 7.2.3.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in an error, and ensure

              <b>AES-CBC Known Answer Tests</b>
              <p/>There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the
              plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each
              test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to
              the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the

              inputs to a known good implementation. <ul>
                <li>KAT-1. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from
                  AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV
                  of all zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit all-zeros
                  key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit all- zeros key. To test
                  the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform the same test as
                  for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC decryption.</li>
                <li>KAT-2. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  a set of 10 key values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC
                  encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all

                  keys. To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform
                  the same test as for encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and
                  AES-CBC decryption.</li>
                <li>KAT-3. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  the two sets of key values described below and obtain the ciphertext value that
                  results from AES encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value
                  and an IV of all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the
                  second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost
                  i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. To test the
                  decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply the two sets of key
                  and ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value that
                  results from AES-CBC decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key and an

                  the set of 128 plaintext values described below and obtain the two ciphertext
                  values that result from AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit
                  key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros and using a 256-bit key value of
                  all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively. Plaintext value i in each set
                  shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for
                  i in [1,128].</li>
              </ul>To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform the
              same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values of the same form as the plaintext in
              the encrypt test as input and AES-CBC decryption. <br/>
              <b>AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test</b>
	      <p/>
              The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block
              message where 1 &lt; i &#x2264; 10. The evaluator will choose a key, an IV and plaintext
              message of length i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with
              the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the result of encrypting
              the same plaintext message with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.
              The evaluator will also test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
              i-block message where 1 &lt; i &#x2264;10. The evaluator will choose a key, an IV and a
              ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode to be
              tested, with the chosen key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of
              decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV using a known good
              implementation. 
	      <br/>
	      <b>AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests</b>
	      <p/>
	      The evaluator will test the encrypt
              functionality using a set of 200 plaintext, IV, and key 3- tuples. 100 of these shall
              use 128 bit keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values shall be
              128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:
              <pre>
              # Input: PT, IV, Key
              for i = 1 to 1000:
                if i == 1:
                      CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                      PT = IV
                else:
                  CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT) 
                  PT = CT[i-1]
              </pre>The
              ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e., CT[1000]) is the result for that
              trial. This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the
              same values using a known good implementation. <br/>The evaluator will test the
              decrypt functionality using the same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and
              replacing AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt. <br/>
              <b>AES-GCM Monte Carlo Tests</b>
              <p/>The evaluator will test the authenticated encrypt functionality of AES-GCM for
              each combination of the following input parameter lengths: <ul>
                <li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</li>
                <li>Two plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be a non-zero integer
                  multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The other plaintext length shall not be an
                  integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</li>
                <li>Three AAD lengths. One AAD length shall be 0, if supported. One AAD length shall
                  be a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One AAD length shall not
                  be an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</li>
                <li>Two IV lengths. If 96 bit IV is supported, 96 bits shall be one of the two IV
                  lengths tested.</li>
              </ul>The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality using a set of 10 key,
              plaintext, AAD, and IV tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and
              obtain the ciphertext value and tag that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt.
              Each supported tag length shall be tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value
              may be supplied by the evaluator or the implementation being tested, as long as it is
              known. <br/>The evaluator will test the decrypt functionality using a set of 10 key,
              ciphertext, tag, AAD, and IV 5-tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above
              and obtain a Pass/Fail result on authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass.
              The set shall include five tuples that Pass and five that Fail. <br/>The results from
              each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs
              to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
              the evaluator will compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the
              same inputs to a known good implementation.<br/>
              <b>AES-CCM Tests</b>
              <p/>The evaluator will test the generation-encryption and decryption-verification
              functionality of AES-CCM for the following input parameter and tag lengths: <ul>
                <li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</li>
                <li>Two payload lengths. One payload length shall be the shortest supported payload
                  length, greater than or equal to zero bytes. The other payload length shall be the
                  longest supported payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits).
                </li>
                <li>Two or three associated data lengths. One associated data length shall be 0, if
                  supported. One associated data length shall be the shortest supported payload length,
                  greater than or equal to zero bytes. One associated data length shall be the longest
                  supported payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits). If the
                  implementation supports an associated data length of 2
                  16 bytes, an associated data length of 216 bytes shall be tested.
                </li>
                <li>Nonce lengths. All supported nonce lengths between 7 and 13 bytes, inclusive, shall
                  be tested.
                </li>
                <li>Tag lengths. All supported tag lengths of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 and 16 bytes shall be
                  tested.
                </li>
              </ul>
              To test the generation-encryption functionality of AES-CCM, the evaluator will perform the
              following four tests: 
	      <testlist>
		<test> For EACH supported key and associated data length and ANY supported
                  payload, nonce and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce
                  value and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values and obtain the resulting
                  ciphertext.
		</test>
		<test>For EACH supported key and payload length and ANY supported associated
                  data, nonce and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce value
                  and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
		</test>

                <test>For EACH supported key and nonce length and ANY supported associated
                  data, payload and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value and 10
                  associated data, payload and nonce value 3-tuples and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
                </test>
                <test>For EACH supported key and tag length and ANY supported associated data,
                  payload and nonce length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce value
                  and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
                </test>
	      </testlist>
              To determine correctness in each of the above tests, the evaluator will compare the
              ciphertext with the result of generation-encryption of the same inputs with a known good
              implementation. <br/>
              To test the decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM, for EACH combination of
              supported associated data length, payload length, nonce length and tag length, the evaluator
              shall supply a key value and 15 nonce, associated data and ciphertext 3-tuples and obtain
              either a FAIL result or a PASS result with the decrypted payload. The evaluator will supply
              10 tuples that should FAIL and 5 that should PASS per set of 15. <br/>
              Additionally, the evaluator will use tests from the IEEE 802.11-02/362r6 document
              “Proposed Test vectors for IEEE 802.11 TGi”, dated September 10, 2002, Section 2.1 AESCCMP
              Encapsulation Example and Section 2.2 Additional AES CCMP Test Vectors to
              further verify the IEEE 802.11-2007 implementation of AES-CCMP. <br/>
              <b>AES-GCM Test</b>
              <p/>The evaluator will test the authenticated encrypt functionality of AES-GCM for each
                combination of the following input parameter lengths:
              <ul>
                <li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</li>
                <li>Two plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be a non-zero integer
                  multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The other plaintext length shall not be an integer
                  multiple of 128 bits, if supported.
                </li>
                <li>Three AAD lengths. One AAD length shall be 0, if supported. One AAD length shall
                  be a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One AAD length shall not be
                  an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.
                </li>
                <li>Two IV lengths. If 96 bit IV is supported, 96 bits shall be one of the two IV lengths
                  tested.
                </li>
              </ul>
              The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality using a set of 10 key, plaintext, AAD, and
              IV tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and obtain the ciphertext value
              and tag that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt. Each supported tag length shall be
              tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value may be supplied by the evaluator or the
              implementation being tested, as long as it is known.<br/>
              The evaluator will test the decrypt functionality using a set of 10 key, ciphertext, tag, AAD,
              and IV 5-tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and obtain a Pass/Fail result
              on authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass. The set shall include five tuples that
              Pass and five that Fail.<br/>
              The results from each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying
              the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
              the evaluator will compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same
              inputs to a known good implementation.<br/>
              <b>XTS-AES Test</b>
              <p/>The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality of XTS-AES for each combination of the
              following input parameter lengths:
              <ul>
                <li>256 bit (for AES-128) and 512 bit (for AES-256) keys</li>
                <li>Three data unit (i.e., plaintext) lengths. One of the data unit lengths shall be a nonzero
                  integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One of the data unit lengths shall be an
                  integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The third data unit length shall be either the
                  longest supported data unit length or 216 bits, whichever is smaller.
                </li>
              </ul>
              using a set of 100 (key, plaintext and 128-bit random tweak value) 3-tuples and obtain the
              ciphertext that results from XTS-AES encrypt.<br/>
              The evaluator may supply a data unit sequence number instead of the tweak value if the
              implementation supports it. The data unit sequence number is a base-10 number ranging
              between 0 and 255 that implementations convert to a tweak value internally.<br/>
              The evaluator will test the decrypt functionality of XTS-AES using the same test as for
              encrypt, replacing plaintext values with ciphertext values and XTS-AES encrypt with XTSAES
              decrypt.<br/>
              <b>AES Key Wrap (AES-KW) and Key Wrap with Padding (AES-KWP) Test</b>
              <p/>The evaluator will test the authenticated encryption functionality of AES-KW for EACH
              combination of the following input parameter lengths:
              <ul>
                <li>128 and 256 bit key encryption keys (KEKs)</li>
                <li>Three plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be two semi-blocks (128
                  bits). One of the plaintext lengths shall be three semi-blocks (192 bits). The third data
                  unit length shall be the longest supported plaintext length less than or equal to 64
                  semi-blocks (4096 bits).
                </li>
              </ul>
              using a set of 100 key and plaintext pairs and obtain the ciphertext that results from AES-KW
              authenticated encryption. To determine correctness, the evaluator will use the AES-KW
              authenticated-encryption function of a known good implementation.<br/>
              The evaluator will test the authenticated-decryption functionality of AES-KW using the
              same test as for authenticated-encryption, replacing plaintext values with ciphertext values
              and AES-KW authenticated-encryption with AES-KW authenticated-decryption.<br/>
              The evaluator will test the authenticated-encryption functionality of AES-KWP using the
              same test as for AES-KW authenticated-encryption with the following change in the three
              plaintext lengths:
              <ul>
                <li>One plaintext length shall be one octet. One plaintext length shall be 20 octets (160
                  bits).</li>
                <li>
                  One plaintext length shall be the longest supported plaintext length less than or equal
                  to 512 octets (4096 bits).
                </li>
              </ul>
              The evaluator will test the authenticated-decryption functionality of AES-KWP using the
              same test as for AES-KWP authenticated-encryption, replacing plaintext values with
              ciphertext values and AES-KWP authenticated-encryption with AES-KWP authenticated-decryption.

              discouraged as there may be risk in accepting these signatures. 
	      <br/>
	      SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with <linkref linkend="FCS_TLSC_EXT.1"/>
	      and, depending on selections, <linkref linkend="FCS_DTLS_EXT.1"/>.
              Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated protocols that support the SHA-2
              family; until updated protocols are supported, this PP allows support for SHA-1
              implementations in compliance with SP 800-131A. 
	      <br/> 
	      The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing function.

            <aactivity> The evaluator will check that the association of the hash function with
              other application cryptographic functions (for example, the digital signature
              verification function) is documented in the TSS. <br/> The <abbr linkend="TSF"/>
              hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the
              byte-oriented mode. In this mode the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> only hashes messages that
              are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length (in bits) of the message
              to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the bit-oriented mode. In this mode
              the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different
              tests for each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the
              bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented testmacs. The evaluator will perform all of the
              following tests for each hash algorithm implemented by the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> and
              used to satisfy the requirements of this PP. <br/> The following tests require the
              developer to provide access to a test application that provides the evaluator with
              tools that are typically not found in the production application.<testlist>
                <test>Short Messages Test (Bit oriented Mode) - The evaluator will generate an input set
                  consisting of m+1 messages, where m is the block length of the hash algorithm. The
                  length of the messages range sequentially from 0 to m bits. The message text shall

                  The length of the <i>i</i>th message is 512 + 99&#x22c5;i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The message

                  implementations only. The evaluator will randomly generate a seed that is n bits long,
                  where n is the length of the message digest produced by the hash function to be

                  by following the algorithm provided in Figure 1 of [SHAVS]. The evaluator will then

              that the "expected values" are produced by a reference implementation of the algorithm
              that is known to be correct. Proof of correctness is left to each Scheme. <testlist>
                <test>The evaluator will perform a Variable Seed Test. The evaluator will

                  is incremented by 1 for each set. The seed values shall have no repeats within the

                  is configurable, the evaluator will perform 15 trials for each configuration. The
                  evaluator will also confirm that the operational guidance contains appropriate

                  (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is

                  uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the

                  less than or equal to seed length. If the implementation only supports one
                  personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values.
                  If more than one string length is support, the evaluator will use personalization
                  strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a

            <note role="application"> The rules for verification of identity are described in
              Section 6 of RFC 6125. The reference identifier is established by the user (e.g.
              entering a URL into a web browser or clicking a link), by configuration (e.g.
              configuring the name of a mail server or authentication server), or by an application
              (e.g. a parameter of an API) depending on the OS service. Based on a singular
              reference identifier’s source domain and application service type (e.g. HTTP, SIP,
              LDAP), the client establishes all reference identifiers which are acceptable, such as
              a Common Name for the Subject Name field of the certificate and a (case-insensitive)
              DNS name, URI name, and Service Name for the Subject Alternative Name field. The
              client then compares this list of all acceptable reference identifiers to the
              presented identifiers in the <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>
              server’s certificate. <br/> The preferred method for verification is the Subject
              Alternative Name using DNS names, URI names, or Service Names. Verification using the
              Common Name is required for the purposes of backwards compatibility. Additionally,
              support for use of IP addresses in the Subject Name or Subject Alternative name is
              discouraged, as against best practices, but may be implemented. Finally, the client
              should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However, if the
              presented identifiers include wildcards, the client must follow the best practices
              regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the assurance activity.

      The Security Objectives for the <abbr linkend="OS"/> in 
      <secref linkend="obj"/> were constructed to address threats identified in
      <secref linkend="threats"/>. The Security Functional Requirements (<abbr linkend="SFR"/>s)
      in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> are a formal instantiation of the Security Objectives. The PP
      identifies the Security Assurance Requirements (<abbr linkend="SAR"/>s) to frame the extent to
      which the evaluator assesses the documentation applicable for the evaluation and performs
      independent testing. <br/> This section lists the set of <abbr linkend="SAR"/>s from CC part 3
      that are required in evaluations against this PP. Individual Assurance Activities
      <!--(AAs). Never use these again --> to be performed are specified both in <secref
        linkend="req"/> as well as in this section. <br/> The general model for evaluation of <abbr
        linkend="OS"/>s against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows: <br/> After the
        <abbr linkend="ST"/> has been approved for evaluation, the <abbr class="expanded"
        title="Information Technology Security Evaluation Facility">ITSEF</abbr> will obtain the
        <abbr linkend="OS"/>, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs. The ITSEF also performs the Assurance Activities
      contained within <secref linkend="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS. The Assurance Activities that are captured in <secref linkend="req"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP. <subsection title="Class ASE: Security Target" id="ase">As per ASE activities
        defined in <cite linkend="bibCEM"/>.</subsection>
      <subsection title="Class ADV: Development" id="adv">The information about the <abbr
          linkend="OS"/> is contained in the guidance documentation available to the end user as
        well as the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> portion of the <abbr linkend="ST"/>. The <abbr
          linkend="OS"/> developer must concur with the description of the product that is
        contained in the TSS as it relates to the functional requirements. The Assurance Activities
        contained in <secref linkend="SFRs"/> should provide the <abbr linkend="ST"/> authors with
        sufficient information to determine the appropriate content for the TSS section.

          functional specification describes the <abbr title="TSF Interface">TSFI</abbr>s. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because <abbr linkend="OS"/>s conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the Operational Environment that are not directly invokable by <abbr linkend="OS"/>
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the <abbr linkend="TSS"/> in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional “functional specification” documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the assurance activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                <abbr linkend="ST"/>, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the <abbr linkend="ST"/> are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the <abbr linkend="OS"/> and its
              platform. <br/> This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be

              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the supporting

  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix"> This appendix
    describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS. <br/>
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the TSS. <section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
      Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product. <br/> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      <br/> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of
      the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary
      outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate. <br/> If implemented, the design
      description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification"> There should be a technical
      argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence
      in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by
      this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy. <br/> The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
      depends on the type of entropy source included in the product. <br/> For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output. <br/> For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the
      OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
      documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this
      third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to “assume” an amount of min-entropy,
      however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular,
      the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST. <br/>
      Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is
      initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy
      rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of
      entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the
      statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the
      calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete. <br/> The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any
      third-party application or from any state saving between restarts. </section>
    <section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be
      affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage,
      frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may
      affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source
      health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health
      tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source. </section>
