  <chapter title="Introduction" id="int">
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview"> The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to
      describe the security functionality of operating systems in terms of <cite linkend="bibCC"/>
      and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products.
      An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software
      resources, and provides common services for application programs. The hardware
      it manages may be physical or virtual.
    </section>
    <section title="Terms" id="glossary"> The following sections provide both Common Criteria and
      technology terms used in this Protection Profile.

            <term><abbr title="Address Space Layout Randomization">ASLR</abbr></term>
            <description>An anti-exploitation feature which loads memory mappings into unpredictable
              locations. ASLR makes it more difficult for an attacker to redirect control to code
              that they have introduced into the address space of a process.</description>

            <term>Administrator</term>
	    <description>
	      An administrator is responsible for management
	      activities, including setting policies that are applied by the
	      enterprise on the operating system.
	      This administrator could be
	      acting remotely through a management server, from which the system
	      receives configuration policies.
	      An administrator can enforce
	      settings on the system which cannot be overridden by
	      non-administrator users.

        The TOE boundary encompasses the <abbr linkend="OS"/> kernel and its drivers, shared

        are those that provide essential security services, many of which run with elevated
        privileges.  Applications which are covered by more-specific Protection Profiles cannot 
        claim evaluation as part of the <abbr linkend="OS"/> evaluation, even when it is necessary to evaluate 
        some of their functionality as it relates to their role as part of the <abbr linkend="OS"/>.

    <section title="Use Cases" id="usecases">Requirements in this Protection Profile are designed to
      address the security problems in at least the following use cases. These use cases are intentionally
      very broad, as many specific use cases exist for an operating system. These use cases may also
      overlap with one another.  An operating system's functionality may even be effectively extended by
      privileged applications installed onto it.  However, these are out of scope of this PP. <usecases>
        <usecase title="End User Devices" id="enduserdevices">
          <description>
	    <h:p>
	    The OS provides a platform for end user devices such as desktops,
	    laptops, convertibles, and tablets.

	    <h:p>
            As this Protection Profile does not address threats against data-at-rest,
            enterprises deploying operating systems in mobile scenarios should ensure that these systems
            include data-at-rest protection spelled out in other 
	    Protection Profiles. Specifically, this includes the Protection Profiles for 
	    <h:i>Full Drive Encryption - Encryption Engine</h:i>, 
	    <h:i>Full Drive Encryption - Authorization Acquisition</h:i>, 
	    and <h:i>Software File Encryption</h:i>.  The <h:i>Protection Profile for Mobile

	      To test the key generation method for the Random Provable primes method and for

              generate the RSA key pair. This includes the random seed(s), the public exponent of
              the RSA key, and the desired key length. For each key length supported, the evaluator
              shall have the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> generate 25 key pairs. The evaluator will verify
              the correctness of the <abbr linkend="TSF"/>'s implementation by comparing values

	      If possible, the Random Probable primes method should also be

              For each supported NIST curve, i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521, the
              evaluator will require the implementation under test (IUT) to generate 10
              private/public key pairs. The private key shall be generated using an approved random
              bit generator (RBG). To determine correctness, the evaluator will submit the
              generated key pairs to the public key verification (PKV) function of a known good
              implementation. 
	     </h:p>
	      <h:p>FIPS 186-4 Public Key Verification (PKV) Test</h:p> 
	      <h:p>
	      For each supported
              NIST curve, i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521, the evaluator will generate 10
              private/public key pairs using the key generation function of a known good
              implementation and modify five of the public key values so that they are incorrect,
              leaving five values unchanged (i.e., correct). The evaluator will obtain in response
              a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

              <h:br/>
              The evaluator will verify the implementation of the Parameters Generation 
              and the Key Generation for FFC by the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> using the Parameter Generation 
              and Key Generation test. 
	      This test verifies the ability of the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> to correctly 
              produce values for the field prime p, the cryptographic prime q (dividing p-1), 
              the cryptographic group generator g, and the calculation of the private 
              key x and public key y.
	      </h:p><h:p>
              The Parameter generation specifies 2 ways (or methods) to generate the 
              cryptographic prime q and the field prime p:

              </h:ul>
              </h:li>
              and two ways to generate the cryptographic group generator g:
              
              <h:li>Cryptographic Group Generator:<h:ul>
                <h:li>Generator g constructed through a verifiable process</h:li>

              </h:ul>
              </h:li>

              The Key generation specifies 2 ways to generate the private key x:              
              
              <h:li>Private Key:<h:ul>
                <h:li>len(q) bit output of RBG where 1 &#x2264; x &#x2264; q-1</h:li>
                <h:li>len(q) + 64 bit output of RBG, followed by a mod q-1 operation where 1 &#x2264; x &#x2264; q-1</h:li>

              </h:li>
              
              The security strength of the RBG must be at least that of the security offered by the FFC parameter set.
              
              To test the cryptographic and field prime generation method for the provable primes method and/or the
              group generator g for a verifiable process, the evaluator must seed the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> parameter 
              generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically generate the parameter set.
              
              For each key length supported, the evaluator will have the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> generate 25 parameter sets 
              and key pairs. The evaluator will verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation 
              by comparing values generated by the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> with those generated from a known good

	      The evaluator will verify the OS's
              implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes using the following Function and
              Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that the OS
              has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the
              specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the
              discrete logarithm cryptography (DLC) primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the
              calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function
              (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator will also verify that the
              components of key confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the test
              procedures described below. This includes the parsing of the DKM, the generation of
              MAC data and the calculation of MAC tag. <h:br/>
              <indent>
		<h:p>
		  <h:b>Function Test</h:b>
		  <h:p>The Function test verifies the ability of the OS to implement the key agreement schemes correctly.
To conduct this test the evaluator will generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the OS's supported schemes.
For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. 
The data set consists of the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys.
These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p> The evaluator will obtain the DKM, the
                corresponding OS's public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any
                inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and OS id fields.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
                If the OS does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator will
                obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
		The
                evaluator will verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation of a given scheme
                by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive
                the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
                If key confirmation is supported, the OS shall perform the above for each
                implemented approved MAC algorithm.

              </h:p>
	      <h:p>
		<h:b>Validity Test</h:b><h:br/>
		<h:p> The Validity test verifies the ability of the OS to
                recognize another party's valid and invalid key agreement results with or without
                key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator will obtain a list of the
                supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A key agreement
                implementation to determine which errors the OS should be able to recognize. The
                evaluator generates a set of 30 test vectors consisting of data
                sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator's
                public keys, the OS's public/private key pairs, MAC tag, and any inputs used in the
                KDF, such as the other info and OS id fields.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
		The evaluator will inject an
                error in some of the test vectors to test that the OS recognizes invalid key
                agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret
                value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MAC'd, or the
                generated MAC tag. If the OS contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key
                validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties'
                static public keys, both parties' ephemeral public keys and the OS's static private
                key to assure the OS detects errors in the public key validation function and/or
                the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors
                shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
                (they should pass).
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
		  The OS shall use these modified test vectors to emulate
                  the key agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator will
                  compare the OS's results with the results using a known good implementation
                  verifying that the OS detects these errors.

                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector
                shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional
                input parameters if applicable, the MAC key and MAC tag if key confirmation is
                incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator
                shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the OS with the same
                inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the MAC
                key from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MAC key used in normal

	      <h:p>
The interface referenced in the requirement could take different forms, the most likely of which is an application programming interface to an OS kernel. There may be various levels of abstraction visible. For instance, in a given implementation, selection a, the application may have access to the file system details and may be able to logically address specific memory locations. In another implementation, selection b, the application may simply have a handle to a resource and can only ask the platform to delete the resource, as may be the case with a platforms secure key store. Selection b should only be used for the most restricted access. The level of detail to which the TOE has access will be reflected in the TSS section of the ST.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
Several selections allow assignment of a 'value that does not contain any CSP'. This means that the TOE uses some other specified data not drawn from a source that may contain key material or reveal information about key material, and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. The point of the phrase 'does not contain any CSP' is to ensure that the overwritten data is carefully selected, and not taken from a general 'pool' that might contain current or residual data that itself requires confidentiality protection.

The evaluator examines the TSS to ensure it describes how the keys are managed in volatile memory. This description includes details of how each identified key is introduced into volatile memory (e.g. by derivation from user input, or by unwrapping a wrapped key stored in non-volatile memory) and how they are overwritten.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
The evaluator will check to ensure the TSS lists each type of key that is stored in in non-volatile memory, and identifies how the TOE interacts with the underlying platform to manage keys (e.g., store, retrieve, destroy). The description includes details on the method of how the TOE interacts with the platform, including an identification and description of the interfaces it uses to manage keys (e.g., file system APIs, platform key store APIs).

<h:h3>Operational Guidance</h:h3>
	      <h:p>
There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The evaluator will check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information. The evaluator will check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer and how such situations can be avoided or mitigated if possible.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
Some examples of what is expected to be in the documentation are provided here. 
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
When the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. In this case, to mitigate this the drive should support the TRIM command and implements garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. To reduce this risk, the operating system and file system of the OE should support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion. If a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. If the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
The drive should be healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and should be end-of-lifed before a significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, this minimizes the risk that small amounts of potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.

	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
		There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the
              plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each
              test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to
              the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the
              evaluator will compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same
              inputs to a known good implementation. <h:ul>
                <h:li>KAT-1. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from
                  AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV
                  of all zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit all-zeros
                  key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit all- zeros key. To test
                  the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform the same test as
                  for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC decryption.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-2. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  a set of 10 key values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC
                  encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all
                  zeros. Five of the keys shall be 128-bit keys, and the other five shall be 256-bit
                  keys. To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform
                  the same test as for encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and
                  AES-CBC decryption.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-3. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  the two sets of key values described below and obtain the ciphertext value that
                  results from AES encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value
                  and an IV of all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the
                  second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost
                  i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. To test the
                  decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply the two sets of key
                  and ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value that
                  results from AES-CBC decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key and an
                  IV of all zeros. The first set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit
                  key/ciphertext pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256
                  256-bit key/ciphertext pairs. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be
                  ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. The ciphertext value in
                  each pair shall be the value that results in an all-zeros plaintext when decrypted
                  with its corresponding key.</h:li>
                <h:li>KAT-4. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  the set of 128 plaintext values described below and obtain the two ciphertext
                  values that result from AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit
                  key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros and using a 256-bit key value of
                  all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively. Plaintext value i in each set
                  shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for
                  i in [1,128].</h:li>
              </h:ul>
	      <h:br/>
	      To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform the
              same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values of the same form as the plaintext in
              the encrypt test as input and AES-CBC decryption.
	      </h:p>
              <h:b>AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test</h:b>
	      <h:p>
              The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block
              message where 1 &lt; i &#x2264; 10. The evaluator will choose a key, an IV and plaintext
              message of length i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with
              the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the result of encrypting
              the same plaintext message with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.
              The evaluator will also test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
              i-block message where 1 &lt; i &#x2264;10. The evaluator will choose a key, an IV and a
              ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode to be
              tested, with the chosen key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of
              decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV using a known good
              implementation.

	    <h:p>
	      <h:b>AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests</h:b>
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>
	      The evaluator will test the encrypt
              functionality using a set of 200 plaintext, IV, and key 3- tuples. 100 of these shall
              use 128 bit keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values shall be
              128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:
              <h:pre>
              # Input: PT, IV, Key
              for i = 1 to 1000:
                if i == 1:
                      CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                      PT = IV
                else:
                  CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT) 
                  PT = CT[i-1]
              </h:pre>The
              ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e., CT[1000]) is the result for that
              trial. This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the
              same values using a known good implementation. 
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>
	      The evaluator will test the
              decrypt functionality using the same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and
              replacing AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt. 
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>
              <h:b>AES-GCM Monte Carlo Tests</h:b>
              <h:p/>The evaluator will test the authenticated encrypt functionality of AES-GCM for
              each combination of the following input parameter lengths: <h:ul>
                <h:li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</h:li>
                <h:li>Two plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be a non-zero integer
                  multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The other plaintext length shall not be an
                  integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</h:li>
                <h:li>Three AAD lengths. One AAD length shall be 0, if supported. One AAD length shall
                  be a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One AAD length shall not
                  be an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</h:li>
                <h:li>Two IV lengths. If 96 bit IV is supported, 96 bits shall be one of the two IV
                  lengths tested.</h:li>
              </h:ul>The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality using a set of 10 key,
              plaintext, AAD, and IV tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and
              obtain the ciphertext value and tag that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt.
              Each supported tag length shall be tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value
              may be supplied by the evaluator or the implementation being tested, as long as it is
              known. 
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>


	      The evaluator will test the decrypt functionality using a set of 10 key,
              ciphertext, tag, AAD, and IV 5-tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above
              and obtain a Pass/Fail result on authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass.
              The set shall include five tuples that Pass and five that Fail. 
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>
	      The results from
              each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs
              to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
              the evaluator will compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the
              same inputs to a known good implementation.

              <h:p><h:b>AES-CCM Tests</h:b></h:p>
	      <h:p>
              The evaluator will test the generation-encryption and decryption-verification
              functionality of AES-CCM for the following input parameter and tag lengths: <h:ul>
                <h:li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</h:li>
                <h:li>Two payload lengths. One payload length shall be the shortest supported payload
                  length, greater than or equal to zero bytes. The other payload length shall be the
                  longest supported payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits).
                </h:li>
                <h:li>Two or three associated data lengths. One associated data length shall be 0, if
                  supported. One associated data length shall be the shortest supported payload length,
                  greater than or equal to zero bytes. One associated data length shall be the longest
                  supported payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits). If the
                  implementation supports an associated data length of 2
                  16 bytes, an associated data length of 216 bytes shall be tested.
                </h:li>
                <h:li>Nonce lengths. All supported nonce lengths between 7 and 13 bytes, inclusive, shall
                  be tested.

              </h:ul>
              To test the generation-encryption functionality of AES-CCM, the evaluator will perform the
              following four tests: 
	      <testlist>
		<test> For EACH supported key and associated data length and ANY supported
                  payload, nonce and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce

		<test>For EACH supported key and payload length and ANY supported associated
                  data, nonce and tag length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce value
                  and 10 pairs of associated data and payload values and obtain the resulting ciphertext.
		</test>

                <test>For EACH supported key and nonce length and ANY supported associated

                <test>For EACH supported key and tag length and ANY supported associated data,
                  payload and nonce length, the evaluator will supply one key value, one nonce value

                </test>
	      </testlist>
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
              To determine correctness in each of the above tests, the evaluator will compare the
              ciphertext with the result of generation-encryption of the same inputs with a known good
              implementation. 
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
              To test the decryption-verification functionality of AES-CCM, for EACH combination of
              supported associated data length, payload length, nonce length and tag length, the evaluator
              shall supply a key value and 15 nonce, associated data and ciphertext 3-tuples and obtain
              either a FAIL result or a PASS result with the decrypted payload. The evaluator will supply
              10 tuples that should FAIL and 5 that should PASS per set of 15. 
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
              Additionally, the evaluator will use tests from the IEEE 802.11-02/362r6 document
              "Proposed Test vectors for IEEE 802.11 TGi", dated September 10, 2002, Section 2.1 AESCCMP

                  tested.
                </h:li>
              </h:ul>
              The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality using a set of 10 key, plaintext, AAD, and
              IV tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and obtain the ciphertext value

                <h:li>256 bit (for AES-128) and 512 bit (for AES-256) keys</h:li>
                <h:li>Three data unit (i.e., plaintext) lengths. One of the data unit lengths shall be a nonzero
                  integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One of the data unit lengths shall be an
                  integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The third data unit length shall be either the
                  longest supported data unit length or 216 bits, whichever is smaller.

              ciphertext that results from XTS-AES encrypt.
	      </h:p>

              using a set of 100 key and plaintext pairs and obtain the ciphertext that results from AES-KW
              authenticated encryption. To determine correctness, the evaluator will use the AES-KW
              authenticated-encryption function of a known good implementation.

	      Per NIST SP 800-131A, SHA-1 for generating digital signatures
              is no longer allowed, and SHA-1 for verification of digital signatures is strongly
              discouraged as there may be risk in accepting these signatures. 
	      </h:p>

	      SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with <linkref linkend="FCS_TLSC_EXT.1"/>
	      and, depending on selections, <linkref linkend="FCS_DTLS_EXT.1"/>.
              Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated protocols that support the SHA-2
              family; until updated protocols are supported, this PP allows support for SHA-1
              implementations in compliance with SP 800-131A. 
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
	      The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing function. 
	      The hash selection must support the message digest

              the algorithm used.

		The <abbr linkend="TSF"/>

              are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length (in bits) of the message
              to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the bit-oriented mode. In this mode
              the <abbr linkend="TSF"/> hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different
              tests for each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the
              bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented testmacs. The evaluator will perform all of the

NIST SP 800-90A contains three different methods of generating random numbers; 
each of these, in turn, depends on underlying cryptographic primitives (hash functions/ciphers). 
The <abbr linkend="ST"/> author will select the function used and include the specific underlying cryptographic primitives used in the requirement or in the <abbr linkend="TSS"/>. 
While any of the identified hash functions (SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) are allowed for Hash_DRBG or HMAC_DRBG,
only AES-based implementations for CTR_DRBG are allowed.

	      </h:p><h:p>
              The evaluator will perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG
              is configurable, the evaluator will perform 15 trials for each configuration. The
              evaluator will also confirm that the operational guidance contains appropriate
              instructions for configuring the RNG functionality. 
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      If the RNG has  prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2)
              generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a second block of random bits
              (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is
              the expected value. The evaluator will generate eight input values for each
              trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and
              personalization string for the instantiate operation. The next two are additional
              input and entropy input for the first call to generate. The final two are
              additional input and entropy input for the second call to generate. These values
              are randomly generated. "generate one block of random bits" means to generate
              random bits with number of returned bits equal to the Output Block Length (as
              defined in NIST SP 800-90A). 
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      If the RNG does not have prediction resistance,
              each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of
              random bits (3) reseed, (4) generate a second block of random bits (5)
              uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the
              expected value. The evaluator will generate eight input values for each trial.
              The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and
              personalization string for the instantiate operation. The fifth value is
              additional input to the first call to generate. The sixth and seventh are

              additional input to the second generate call. 
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      The following list contains more information on some of the input values to be generated/selected by the evaluator.
	      <h:ul>
		<h:li> <h:b>Entropy input:</h:b> The length of the entropy input value must equal the seed
                  length.</h:li>
		  
                  <h:li><h:b>Nonce:</h:b> If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation Function does
                  not use a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed length. </h:li>
                  <h:li><h:b>Personalization string:</h:b> The length of the personalization string must be
                  less than or equal to seed length. If the implementation only supports one
                  personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values.
                  If more than one string length is support, the evaluator will use personalization
                  strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a
                  personalization string, no value needs to be supplied. </h:li>
                  <h:li><h:b>Additional input:</h:b> The additional input bit lengths have the same defaults
                  and restrictions as the personalization string lengths.</h:li>

            <note role="application"> 
	      <h:p>
	      The rules for verification of identity are described in
              Section 6 of RFC 6125. The reference identifier is established by the user (e.g.
              entering a URL into a web browser or clicking a link), by configuration (e.g.
              configuring the name of a mail server or authentication server), or by an application
              (e.g. a parameter of an API) depending on the OS service. Based on a singular
              reference identifier's source domain and application service type (e.g. HTTP, SIP,
              LDAP), the client establishes all reference identifiers which are acceptable, such as
              a Common Name for the Subject Name field of the certificate and a (case-insensitive)
              DNS name, URI name, and Service Name for the Subject Alternative Name field. The
              client then compares this list of all acceptable reference identifiers to the
              presented identifiers in the <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr>
              server's certificate.
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      The preferred method for verification is the Subject
              Alternative Name using DNS names, URI names, or Service Names. Verification using the
              Common Name is required for the purposes of backwards compatibility. Additionally,
              support for use of IP addresses in the Subject Name or Subject Alternative name is
              discouraged, as against best practices, but may be implemented. Finally, the client
              should avoid constructing reference identifiers using wildcards. However, if the
              presented identifiers include wildcards, the client must follow the best practices
              regarding matching; these best practices are captured in the evaluation activity.

		  The evaluator will examine the traffic from both step one and step two to verify that all non-excepted Data Plane traffic in Step 2 is encapsulated by IPsec.
		  The evaluator will examine the Security Parameter Index (SPI) value present in the encapsulated packets captured in Step 2 from the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to the Gateway and shall verify this value is the same for all actions used to generate traffic through the VPN. 
		  Note that it is expected that the SPI value for packets from the Gateway to the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> is different than the SPI value for packets from the <abbr linkend="TOE"/> to the Gateway.

          and "User" columns to "X" according to which capabilities are present or not present,
          and for which privilege level. The Application Note for FMT_MOF_EXT.1 explains

The evaluator will verify that every management function captured in the ST is described in the operational guidance and that the description contains the information required to perform the management duties associated with the management function.
The evaluator will test the OS's ability to provide the management functions by configuring the operating system and testing each option selected from above.
The evaluator is expected to test these functions in all the ways in which the ST and guidance documentation state the configuration can be managed.

Many OSes store control flow values (i.e. return addresses) in stack data structures that also contain parameters and variables.
For these OSes, it is expected that most of the OS, to include the kernel, libraries, and application software from the OS vendor be compiled with stack-based buffer overflow protection enabled.
OSes that store parameters and variables separately from control flow values do not need additional stack protections.

      contained within <secref linkend="req"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the

              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This

        vulnerabilities will require sophistication beyond that of a basic attacker. Until
        penetration tools are created and uniformly distributed to the evaluation labs, the
        evaluator will not be expected to test for these vulnerabilities in the <abbr linkend="OS"
        />. The labs will be expected to comment on the likelihood of these vulnerabilities given
        the documentation provided by the vendor. This information will be used in the development
        of penetration testing tools and for the development of future protection profiles.

  <appendix title="Optional Requirements" id="optional"> As indicated in <secref linkend="ccl"/>,
    the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the OS) are
    contained in the body of this PP. Additionally, there are three other types of requirements
    specified in <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref
      linkend="objective"/>. The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be included
    in the <abbr linkend="ST"/>, but are not required in order for a OS to claim conformance to
    this PP. The second type (in <appref linkend="sel-based"/>) are requirements based on selections
    in the body of the PP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in that
    appendix must be included. The third type (in <appref linkend="objective"/> are components that
    are not required in order to conform to this PP, but will be included in the baseline
    requirements in future versions of this PP, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note that the
    ST author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with those in
      <appref linkend="optional"/>, <appref linkend="sel-based"/>, and <appref linkend="objective"/>
    but are not listed (e.g., FMT-type requirements) are also included in the ST. </appendix>

  <appendix title="Selection-Based Requirements" id="sel-based"> As indicated in the introduction to
    this PP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the OS or its underlying
    platform) are contained in the body of this PP. There are additional requirements based on
    selections in the body of the PP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements
    below will need to be included. </appendix>

  <appendix title="Objective Requirements" id="objective"> This appendix includes requirements that
    specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently
    mandated in the body of this PP as they describe security functionality not yet widely-available
    in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the
    OS is still conformant to this PP, and it is expected that they be included as soon as
    possible. </appendix>

  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix">
    <h:p>
      This appendix describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS.
    </h:p>
    <h:p>
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator will thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the <abbr linkend="TSS"/>.
    </h:p>
    <section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
      <h:p>
      Documentation shall include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product.
      </h:p>
      <h:p> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      </h:p>
      <h:p> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of
      the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary
      outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>If implemented, the design
      description shall include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on shall be included.
      </h:p>
    </section>
    <section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification">
      <h:p>
      There should be a technical
      argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence
      in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by
      this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
	depends on the type of entropy source included in the product.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the
      OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
      documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this
      third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to "assume" an amount of min-entropy,
      however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular,
      the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	
      Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is
      initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy
      rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of
      entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the
      statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the
      calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	The entropy justification shall not include any data added from any
	third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.
      </h:p>
    </section>
    <section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be
      affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage,
      frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may
      affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation shall
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source shall be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source
      health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health
      tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source. </section>
