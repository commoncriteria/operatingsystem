# ExecuteDaisy
A fork of [DaisyDiff](https://code.google.com/archive/p/daisydiff/) that has some extra goodies. 
#### Additions:
 - save_page.js
	 - to be used with [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org/) to make the diff file usable outside of the ExecuteDaisy directory

This is a work in progress.
