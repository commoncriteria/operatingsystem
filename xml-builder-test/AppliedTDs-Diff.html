        The scope of this Protection Profile (<abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_PP">PP</a></abbr>) is to describe the security functionality of operating systems in terms of 
        <xref g="CC"></xref>
         and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for application programs. The hardware it manages may be physical or virtual. 
        <tech-terms>
             
            <term full="Address Space Layout Randomization" abbr="ASLR"> An anti-exploitation feature which loads memory mappings into unpredictable locations. ASLR makes it more difficult for an attacker to redirect control to code that they have introduced into the address space of a process. </term>
             
            <term full="Administrator" abbr="null"> An administrator is responsible for management activities, including setting policies that are applied by the enterprise on the operating system. This administrator could be acting remotely through a management server, from which the system receives configuration policies. An administrator can enforce settings on the system which cannot be overridden by non-administrator users. </term>
             
            <term full="Application" abbr="app"> Software that runs on a platform and performs tasks on behalf of the user or owner of the platform, as well as its supporting documentation. </term>
             
            <term full="Application Programming Interface" abbr="API"> A specification of routines, data structures, object classes, and variables that allows an application to make use of services provided by another software component, such as a library. APIs are often provided for a set of libraries included with the platform. </term>
             
            <term full="Credential" abbr="null"> Data that establishes the identity of a user, e.g. a cryptographic key or password. </term>
             
            <term full="Critical Security Parameters" abbr="CSP"> Information that is either user or system defined and is used to operate a cryptographic module in processing encryption functions including cryptographic keys and authentication data, such as passwords, the disclosure or modification of which can compromise the security of a cryptographic module or the security of the information protected by the module. </term>
             
            <term full="DAR Protection" abbr="null"> Countermeasures that prevent attackers, even those with physical access, from extracting data from non-volatile storage. Common techniques include data encryption and wiping. </term>
             
            <term full="Data Execution Prevention" abbr="DEP"> An anti-exploitation feature of modern operating systems executing on modern computer hardware, which enforces a non-execute permission on pages of memory. DEP prevents pages of memory from containing both data and instructions, which makes it more difficult for an attacker to introduce and execute code. </term>
             
            <term full="Developer" abbr="null"> An entity that writes OS software. For the purposes of this document, vendors and developers are the same. </term>
             
            <term full="General Purpose Operating System" abbr="null"> A class of OSes designed to support a wide-variety of workloads consisting of many concurrent applications or services. Typical characteristics for OSes in this class include support for third-party applications, support for multiple users, and security separation between users and their respective resources. General Purpose Operating Systems also lack the real-time constraint that defines Real Time Operating Systems which are typically used in routers, switches, and embedded devices. </term>
             
            <term full="Hybrid Authentication" abbr="null"> A hybrid authentication factor is one where a user has to submit a combination of a cryptographic token and a PIN or password and both must pass. If either factor fails, the entire attempt fails. </term>
             
            <term full="Host-based Firewall" abbr="null"> A software-based firewall implementation running on the OS for filtering inbound and outbound network traffic to and from processes running on the OS. </term>
             
            <term full="Operating System" abbr="OS">
                 Software that manages physical and logical resources and provides services for applications. The terms <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr> and OS are interchangeable in this document. 
            </term>
             
            <term full="Personal Identification Number" abbr="PIN"> An authentication factor that is comprised of a set of numeric or alphabetic characters that may be used in addition to a cryptographic token to provide a hybrid authentication factor. At this time it is not considered as a stand-alone authentication mechanism. A PIN is distinct from a password in that the allowed character set and required length of a PIN is typically smaller than that of a password as it is designed to be input quickly. </term>
             
            <term full="Personally Identifiable Information" abbr="PII"> Any information about an individual maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical history, and criminal or employment history and information which can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as their name, social security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, biometric records, etc., including any other personal information which is linked or linkable to an individual.</term>
             
            <term full="Sensitive Data" abbr="null">
                 Sensitive data may include all user or enterprise data or may be specific application data such as PII, emails, messaging, documents, calendar items, and contacts. Sensitive data must minimally include credentials and keys. Sensitive data shall be identified in the OS's <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSS">TSS</a></abbr> by the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_ST">ST</a></abbr> author.

        <h3 class="indexable" data-level="3" id="TOE_Boundary">1.2.1 TOE Boundary</h3>
         The <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr> boundary encompasses the OS kernel and its drivers, shared software libraries, and some application software included with the OS. The applications considered within the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr> are those that provide essential security services, many of which run with elevated privileges. Applications which are covered by more-specific Protection Profiles cannot claim evaluation as part of the OS evaluation, even when it is necessary to evaluate some of their functionality as it relates to their role as part of the OS.

        <h3 class="indexable" data-level="3" id="TOE_Platform">1.2.2 TOE Platform</h3>
         The <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr> platform, which consists of the physical or virtual hardware on which the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr> executes, is outside the scope of evaluation. At the same time, the security of the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr> relies upon it. Other hardware components which independently run their own software and are relevant to overall system security are also outside the scope of evaluation. 
        <h2 class="indexable" data-level="2" id="Use_Cases">1.3 Use Cases</h2>
        Requirements in this Protection Profile are designed to address the security problems in at least the following use cases. These use cases are intentionally very broad, as many specific use cases exist for an operating system. These use cases may also overlap with one another. An operating system's functionality may even be effectively extended by privileged applications installed onto it. However, these are out of scope of this <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_PP">PP</a></abbr>.

                <description>The OS provides a platform for end user devices such as desktops, laptops, convertibles, and tablets. These devices may optionally be bound to a directory server or management server. As this Protection Profile does not address threats against data-at-rest, enterprises deploying operating systems in mobile scenarios should ensure that these systems include data-at-rest protection spelled out in other Protection Profiles. Specifically, this includes the Protection Profiles for Full Drive Encryption - Encryption Engine, Full Drive Encryption - Authorization Acquisition, and Software File Encryption. The Protection Profile for Mobile Device Fundamentals includes requirements for data-at-rest protection and is appropriate for many mobile devices.</description>

                                        The evaluator will verify the implementation of RSA Key Generation by the OS using the Key Generation test.

Key Pair generation specifies 5 ways (or methods) to generate the primes p and q. These include:

                                         To test the key generation method for the Random Provable primes method and for all the Primes with Conditions methods, the evaluator must seed the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSF">TSF</a></abbr> key generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically generate the RSA key pair. This includes the random seed(s), the public exponent of the RSA key, and the desired key length. For each key length supported, the evaluator shall have the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSF">TSF</a></abbr> generate 25 key pairs. The evaluator will verify the correctness of the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSF">TSF</a></abbr>'s implementation by comparing values generated by the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSF">TSF</a></abbr> with those generated from a known good implementation.

                                     If possible, the Random Probable primes method should also be verified against a known good implementation as described above. Otherwise, the evaluator will have the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSF">TSF</a></abbr> generate 10 keys pairs for each supported key length nlen and verify:

                                     <b>SP800-56A Key Establishment Schemes</b>
                                    <p> The evaluator will verify the OS's implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes using the following Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that the OS has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the discrete logarithm cryptography (DLC) primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator will also verify that the components of key confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the test procedures described below. This includes the parsing of the DKM, the generation of MAC data and the calculation of MAC tag. </p>
                                    <div>
                                        <b>Function Test</b>
                                        <p>The Function test verifies the ability of the OS to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator will generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the OS's supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester will generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FCC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested. </p>
                                        <p></p>
                                         The evaluator will obtain the DKM, the corresponding OS's public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and OS id fields. 
                                        <p></p>
                                         If the OS does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator will obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret. 
                                        <p></p>
                                         The evaluator will verify the correctness of the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSF">TSF</a></abbr>'s implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values. 
                                        <p></p>
                                         If key confirmation is supported, the OS will perform the above for each implemented approved MAC algorithm. 
                                        <p></p>
                                        <b>Validity Test</b>
                                        <p> The Validity test verifies the ability of the OS to recognize another party's valid and invalid key agreement results with or without key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator will obtain a list of the supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A Revision 3 key agreement implementation to determine which errors the OS should be able to recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 FCC or 30 ECC test vectors consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator's public keys, the OS's public/private key pairs, MAC tag, and any inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and OS id fields. </p>
                                        <p></p>
                                         The evaluator will inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the OS recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MACed, or the generated MAC tag. If the OS contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties' static public keys, both parties' ephemeral public keys and the OS's static private key to assure the OS detects errors in the public key validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors will remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should pass). 
                                        <p></p>
                                         The OS will use these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator will compare the OS's results with the results using a known good implementation verifying that the OS detects these errors.

                                 There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The evaluator will check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSS">TSS</a></abbr> and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information. The evaluator will check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer and how such situations can be avoided or mitigated if possible. 
                            </p>
                            <p></p>
                             Some examples of what is expected to be in the documentation are provided here. 
                            <p></p>
                             When the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr> does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. In this case, to mitigate this the drive should support the TRIM command and implements garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks. 
                            <p></p>
                             Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. To reduce this risk, the operating system and file system of the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_OE">OE</a></abbr> should support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion. If a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. If the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel. 
                            <p></p>
                             The drive should be healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and should be end-of-lifed before a significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, this minimizes the risk that small amounts of potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.

                                     There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values will be 256-bit blocks. The results from each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the evaluator will compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known good implementation. To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform the same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values of the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input and AES-CBC decryption.

                             The <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSF">TSF</a></abbr> hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte-oriented mode. In this mode the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSF">TSF</a></abbr> only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the bit-oriented mode. In this mode the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TSF">TSF</a></abbr> hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different tests for each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented test MACs.

                             The evaluator will perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG is configurable, the evaluator will perform 15 trials for each configuration. The evaluator will also confirm that the operational guidance contains appropriate instructions for configuring the RNG functionality. 
                            <p></p>
                             If the RNG has prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a second block of random bits (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator will generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 &ndash; 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The next two are additional input and entropy input for the first call to generate. The final two are additional input and entropy input for the second call to generate. These values are randomly generated. "generate one block of random bits" means to generate random bits with number of returned bits equal to the Output Block Length (as defined in NIST SP 800-90A). 
                            <p></p>
                             If the RNG does not have prediction resistance, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of random bits (3) reseed, (4) generate a second block of random bits (5) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the expected value. The evaluator will generate eight input values for each trial. The first is a count (0 &ndash; 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and personalization string for the instantiate operation. The fifth value is additional input to the first call to generate. The sixth and seventh are additional input and entropy input to the call to reseed. The final value is additional input to the second generate call.

                                    <b>Nonce:</b> If a nonce is supported (CTR_DRBG with no Derivation Function does not use a nonce), the nonce bit length is one-half the seed length.

If the implementation only supports one personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values. If more than one string length is support, the evaluator will use personalization strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a personalization string, no value needs to be supplied.

                        <p> Some Bluetooth services incur more serious consequences if unauthorized remote devices gain access to them. Such services should be protected by measures like disabling support for the associated Bluetooth profile unless it is actively being used by an application on the OS (in order to prevent discovery by a Service Discovery Protocol search), and then requiring explicit user action to enable those profiles in order to use the services. It may be further appropriate to require additional user action before granting a remote device access to that service. </p>

                         For example, it may be appropriate to disable the OBEX Push Profile until a user pushes a button in an application indicating readiness to transfer an object. After completion of the object transfer, support for the OBEX profile should be suspended until the next time the user requests its use.

                             The bootchain of the OS is the sequence of software, to include the OS loader, the kernel, system drivers or modules, and system files, which ultimately result in loading the OS. The first part of the OS, usually referred to as the first-stage bootloader, must be loaded by the platform. Assessing its integrity, while critical, is the platform's responsibility; and therefore outside the scope of this <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_PP">PP</a></abbr>. All software loaded after this stage is potentially within the control of the OS and is in scope. 
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                         The verification may be transitive in nature: a hardware-protected public key, X509 certificate or hash may be used to verify the mutable bootloader code which contains a key, certificate, or hash used by the bootloader to verify the mutable OS kernel code, which contains a key, certificate, or hash to verify the next layer of executable code, and so on. However, the way in which the hardware stores and protects these keys is out of scope. 
                        <p></p>
                         If all executable code (including bootloader(s), kernel, device drivers, pre-loaded applications, user-loaded applications, and libraries) is verified,

                         should be selected. 
                        <p></p>
                         If certificates are used, they can be hardware-protected trust store elements or leaf certificates in a certificate chain that terminates in a root CA which is an element of a hardware protected trust store. If the certificates themselves are not trust store elements, revocation information is expected to be available for each CA certificate in the chain that is not a trust element, in accordance to FIA_X509_EXT.1.

The <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_ST">ST</a></abbr> author will select whether revocation status is verified using OCSP or CRLs. FIA_X509_EXT.2 requires that certificates are used for HTTPS, TLS, and DTLS; this use requires that the <i>extendedKeyUsage</i> rules are verified. 
                        </p>
                        <p></p>
                         OCSP stapling and OCSP multi-stapling only support TLS server certificate validation. If other certificate types are validated, either OCSP or CRL should be claimed. If OCSP is not supported the EKU provision for checking the OCSP Signing purpose is met by default. 
                        <p></p>
                         If the OS receives server certificates presented for EST, then the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_ST">ST</a></abbr> author should make the selection for EST in the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_SFR">SFR</a></abbr>.

For example, for the use case "update functions when network connections are not available, notice of a compromised certificate disables automatic updates."

                                 The tests described must be performed in conjunction with the other certificate services evaluation activities, including the functions in FIA_X509_EXT.2.1. The evaluator will create a chain of at least four certificates: the node certificate to be tested, two Intermediate CAs, and the self-signed Root CA. 
                                <test> The evaluator will demonstrate that validating a certificate without a valid certification path results in the function failing, for each of the following reasons, in turn: by establishing a certificate path in which one of the issuing certificates is not a CA certificate, by omitting the basicConstraints field in one of the issuing certificates, by setting the basicConstraints field in an issuing certificate to have CA=False, by omitting the CA signing bit of the key usage field in an issuing certificate, and by setting the path length field of a valid CA field to a value strictly less than the certificate path. The evaluator will then establish a valid certificate path consisting of valid CA certificates, and demonstrate that the function succeeds. The evaluator will then remove trust in one of the CA certificates, and show that the function fails. </test>

                                <test> The evaluator will test that the OS can properly handle revoked certificates - conditional on whether CRL, OCSP, OCSP stapling, or OCSP multi-stapling is selected; if multiple methods are selected, then a test will be performed for each method. The evaluator will test revocation of the node certificate and revocation of the intermediate CA certificate (i.e. the intermediate CA certificate should be revoked by the root CA). If OCSP stapling per RFC 6066 is the only supported revocation method, testing revocation of the intermediate CA certificate is omitted. The evaluator will ensure that a valid certificate is used, and that the validation function succeeds. The evaluator then attempts the test with a certificate that has been revoked (for each method chosen in the selection) to ensure when the certificate is no longer valid that the validation function fails.</test>
                                 
                                <test> If any OCSP option is selected, the evaluator will configure the OCSP server or use a man-in-the-middle tool to present a certificate that does not have the OCSP signing purpose and verify that validation of the OCSP response fails. If CRL is selected, the evaluator will configure the CA to sign a CRL with a certificate that does not have the cRLsign key usage bit set and verify that validation of the CRL fails.</test>
                                 
                                <test> The evaluator will modify any byte in the first eight bytes of the certificate and demonstrate that the certificate fails to validate. (The certificate will fail to parse correctly.)</test>
                                 
                                <test> The evaluator will modify any byte in the last byte of the certificate and demonstrate that the certificate fails to validate. (The signature on the certificate will not validate.)</test>

        <h1 id="opt-app" class="indexable" data-level="A">Appendix A - Optional Requirements</h1>
         As indicated in the introduction to this <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_PP">PP</a></abbr>, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr>) are contained in the body of this <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_PP">PP</a></abbr>. This appendix contains three other types of optional requirements:
        <br>
        <br>
         The first type, defined in Appendix <a href="#optional-reqs" class="dynref">A.1 Strictly Optional Requirements</a>, are strictly optional requirements. If the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr> meets any of these requirements the vendor is encouraged to claim the associated <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_SFR">SFRs</a></abbr> in the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_ST">ST</a></abbr>, but doing so is not required in order to conform to this <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_PP">PP</a></abbr>.
        <br>
        <br>
         The second type, defined in Appendix <a href="#objective-reqs" class="dynref">A.2 Objective Requirements</a>, are objective requirements. These describe security functionality that is not yet widely available in commercial technology. Objective requirements are not currently mandated by this <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_PP">PP</a></abbr>, but will be mandated in the future. Adoption by vendors is encouraged, but claiming these <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_SFR">SFRs</a></abbr> is not required in order to conform to this <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_PP">PP</a></abbr>.
        <br>
        <br>
         The third type, defined in Appendix <a href="#feat-based-reqs" class="dynref">A.3 Implementation-dependent Requirements</a>, are Implementation-dependent requirements. If the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_TOE">TOE</a></abbr> implements the product features associated with the listed <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_SFR">SFRs</a></abbr>, either the <abbr class="dyn-abbr"><a href="#abbr_SFR">SFRs</a></abbr> must be claimed or the product features must be disabled in the evaluated ocnfiguration.
