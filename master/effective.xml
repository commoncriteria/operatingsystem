  <sec:Introduction>
    <sec:Overview> 
The scope of this Protection Profile (PP) is to
describe the security functionality of operating systems in terms of <xref g="CC"/>
and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products.
An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software
resources, and provides common services for application programs. The hardware
it manages may be physical or virtual.
    </sec:Overview>
    <tech-terms>
      <term abbr="AES" full="Advanced Encryption Standard"/>
      <term full="Address Space Layout Randomization" abbr="ASLR">
	An anti-exploitation feature which loads memory mappings into unpredictable
	locations. ASLR makes it more difficult for an attacker to redirect control to code
	that they have introduced into the address space of a process.
      </term>
      <term full="Administrator">
	An administrator is responsible for management activities, including setting policies that are 
	applied by the enterprise on the operating system.
	This administrator could be acting remotely through a management server, from which the system
	receives configuration policies.
	An administrator can enforce settings on the system which cannot be overridden by non-administrator users.
      </term>
      <term full="Application" abbr="app">
	Software that runs on a platform and performs tasks on behalf of the user
	or owner of the platform, as well as its supporting documentation. 
      </term>
      <term full="Application Programming Interface" abbr="API">
	A specification of routines, data structures, object classes, and variables
	that allows an application to make use of services provided by another software
	component, such as a library. APIs are often provided for a set of libraries included
	with the platform.
      </term>
      <!-- <term full="Biometric Authentication Factor" abbr="BAF" plural="BAFs"> Authentication factor, which uses -->

      <term abbr="CRL" full="Certificate Revocation List"/>
      <term abbr="CSA" full="Computer Security Act"/>
      <term full="Critical Security Parameters" abbr="CSP">
	Information that is either user or system defined and
	is used to operate a cryptographic module in processing encryption functions including
	cryptographic keys and authentication data, such as passwords, the disclosure or modification
	of which can compromise the security of a cryptographic module or the security of the
	information protected by the module.
      </term>
      <term full="Data At Rest" abbr="DAR"/>
      <term full="DAR Protection">
	Countermeasures that prevent attackers, even those with physical access,
	from extracting data from non-volatile storage.
	Common techniques include data encryption and wiping.
      </term>
      <term full="Data Execution Prevention" abbr="DEP">
	An anti-exploitation feature of modern operating systems executing on
	modern computer hardware, which enforces a non-execute permission on pages of memory.
	DEP prevents pages of memory from containing both data and instructions, which makes
	it more difficult for an attacker to introduce and execute code.
      </term>
      <term abbr="DES" full="Data Encryption Standard"/>
      <term full="Developer">
	An entity that writes OS software. For the purposes of this document,

	A class of OSes designed to support a wide-variety of workloads consisting of many concurrent applications or services.
	Typical characteristics for OSes in this class include support for third-party applications,
	support for multiple users, and security separation between users and their respective resources.
	General Purpose Operating Systems also lack the real-time constraint that defines Real Time Operating Systems
	which are typically used in routers, switches, and embedded devices.
      </term>
      <term full="Hybrid Authentication">
	A hybrid authentication factor is one where a user has to
	submit a combination of a cryptographic token and a PIN or password and both must pass.

    <sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
      Compliant TOEs will implement security functionality in the following general areas:
      <h:ul>
        <h:li>Accountability: ensuring that information exists to discover unintentional issues with the configuration and operation of the TOE so that the root cause can be determined.</h:li>
        <h:li>Integrity: ensuring the integrity of updates to the TOE and enforcing mechanisms that control the deployment and execution of applications running on it.</h:li>
        <h:li>Management: providing mechanisms for configuration of the TSF and deployment of applications running on the TOE.</h:li>
        <h:li>Protected Storage: ensuring that credentials and file system data are not subject to unauthorized disclosure.</h:li>
        <h:li>Protected Communications: ensuring that sensitive data in transit to and from the TOE is adequately protected from unauthorized modification and disclosure.</h:li>
      </h:ul>
      <sec:TOE_Boundary>
        The TOE boundary encompasses the OS kernel and its drivers, shared
        software libraries, and some application software included with the OS. The applications considered within the TOE
        are those that provide essential security services, many of which run with elevated
        privileges.  Applications which are covered by more-specific Protection Profiles cannot
        claim evaluation as part of the OS evaluation, even when it is necessary to evaluate
        some of their functionality as it relates to their role as part of the OS.
        <figure entity="images/Toe.png" title="General TOE " id="toe"/>
      </sec:TOE_Boundary>
      <sec:TOE_Platform>
	The TOE platform, which consists of the physical or virtual hardware on which the TOE executes,
        is outside the scope of evaluation.  At the same time, the security of the TOE relies upon it.
        Other hardware components which independently run their own software and are
        relevant to overall system security are also outside the scope of evaluation.
      </sec:TOE_Platform>
    </sec:Compliant_Targets_of_Evaluation>
    <sec:Use_Cases>Requirements in this Protection Profile are designed to
      address the security problems in at least the following use cases. These use cases are intentionally
      very broad, as many specific use cases exist for an operating system. These use cases may also
      overlap with one another.  An operating system's functionality may even be effectively extended by
      privileged applications installed onto it.  However, these are out of scope of this PP.
      <usecases>
        <usecase title="End User Devices" id="enduserdevices">
          <description>
	    <h:p>
	    The OS provides a platform for end user devices such as desktops,
	    laptops, convertibles, and tablets.
	    These devices may optionally be bound to a directory server or management server.
	    </h:p>
	    <h:p>
            As this Protection Profile does not address threats against data-at-rest,
            enterprises deploying operating systems in mobile scenarios should ensure that these systems
            include data-at-rest protection spelled out in other
	    Protection Profiles. Specifically, this includes the Protection Profiles for
	    <h:i>Full Drive Encryption - Encryption Engine</h:i>,
	    <h:i>Full Drive Encryption - Authorization Acquisition</h:i>,
	    and <h:i>Software File Encryption</h:i>.  The <h:i>Protection Profile for Mobile
		Device Fundamentals</h:i> includes requirements for data-at-rest protection and is appropriate
		for many mobile devices.
	    </h:p>
          </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Server Systems" id="serversystems">
          <description>The OS provides a platform for server-side services, either on
            physical or virtual hardware.  Many specific examples exist in which the OS acts
            as a platform for such services, including file servers, mail servers, and web servers.
          </description>
        </usecase>
        <usecase title="Cloud Systems" id="cloudsystems">
          <description>
	    <h:p>
	      The OS provides a platform for providing cloud services running on
              physical or virtual hardware.  An OS is typically part of offerings
              identified as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS),
              and Platform as a Service (PaaS).
	    </h:p>

		      The evaluator shall verify the OS's
		      implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes using the following Function and
		      Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that the OS
		      has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the
		      specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the
		      discrete logarithm cryptography (DLC) primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the
		      calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function
		      (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator shall also verify that the
		      components of key confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the test
		      procedures described below. This includes the parsing of the DKM, the generation of
		    MAC data and the calculation of MAC tag. </h:p>
		    <h:div style="margin-left: 40px">
		      <h:b>Function Test</h:b>
		      <h:p>The Function test verifies the ability of the OS to implement the key agreement schemes correctly.
		      To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the OS's supported schemes.
		      For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination,
		      the tester will generate 10 sets of test vectors.
		      The data set consists of one set of domain parameter values (FCC) or the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys.
		      These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
		      </h:p>
		      <h:p> The evaluator shall obtain the DKM, the
                      corresponding OS's public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any
                      inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and OS id fields.
		      </h:p>
		      <h:p>
			If the OS does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator shall
			obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret.
		      </h:p>
		      <h:p>
			The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation of a given scheme
			by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive
			the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.
		      </h:p>
		      <h:p>
			If key confirmation is supported, the OS will perform the above for each
			implemented approved MAC algorithm.
		      </h:p>
		      <h:p>
		<h:b>Validity Test</h:b><h:br/>
		<h:p> The Validity test verifies the ability of the OS to
                recognize another party's valid and invalid key agreement results with or without
                key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the
                supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A Revision 3 key agreement
                implementation to determine which errors the OS should be able to recognize.
		The
                evaluator generates a set of 24 FCC or 30 ECC test vectors consisting of data
                sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator's
                public keys, the OS's public/private key pairs, MAC tag, and any inputs used in the
                KDF, such as the other info and OS id fields.
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
		The evaluator shall inject an
                error in some of the test vectors to test that the OS recognizes invalid key
                agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret
                value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MACed, or the
                generated MAC tag. If the OS contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key
                validation, the evaluator shall also individually inject errors in both parties'
                static public keys, both parties' ephemeral public keys and the OS's static private
                key to assure the OS detects errors in the public key validation function and/or
                the partial key validation function (in ECC only).
		At least two of the test vectors will remain unmodified and therefore
		should result in valid key agreement results
                (they should pass).
		</h:p>
		<h:p>
		  The OS will use these modified test vectors to emulate
                  the key agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall
                  compare the OS's results with the results using a known good implementation
                  verifying that the OS detects these errors.

The evaluator shall check to ensure the TSS lists each type of key that is stored in in non-volatile memory, and identifies how the TOE interacts with the underlying platform to manage keys (e.g., store, retrieve, destroy).

	      <h:p>
There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information. The evaluator shall check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer and how such situations can be avoided or mitigated if possible.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
Some examples of what is expected to be in the documentation are provided here.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
When the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. In this case, to mitigate this the drive should support the TRIM command and implements garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. To reduce this risk, the operating system and file system of the OE should support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion. If a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. If the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
The drive should be healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and should be end-of-lifed before a significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, this minimizes the risk that small amounts of potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.

      <h:p>
        The interface referenced in the requirement could take different forms, 
        the most likely of which is an application programming interface to an OS kernel. 
        There may be various levels of abstraction visible.
        For instance, in a given implementation that overwrites a key stored in non-volatile memory, 
        the application may have access to the file system details and 
        may be able to logically address specific memory locations.
        In another implementation, that instructs the underlying platform to destroy the 
        representation of a key stored in non-volatile memory, 
        the application may simply have a handle to a resource and 
        can only ask the platform to delete the resource, as may be the case with a platforms secure key store.
        The latter implementation should only be used for the most restricted access.
        The level of detail to which the TOE has access will be reflected in the TSS section of the ST.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
        Several selections allow assignment of a 'value that does not contain any CSP.'
        This means that the TOE uses some other specified data not drawn from a source that 
        may contain key material or reveal information about key material, 
        and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. 
        The point of the phrase 'does not contain any CSP' is to ensure that the overwritten 
        data is carefully selected, and not taken from a general 'pool' that might contain current or 
        residual data that itself requires confidentiality protection.

      <h:p>      
        For the selection <xref to="s-kek-kill"/>,
        a key can be considered destroyed by destroying the key that protects the key.
        If a key is wrapped or encrypted it is not necessary to "overwrite" that key,
        overwriting the key that is used to wrap or encrypt the key used to encrypt/decrypt data,
        using the appropriate method for the memory type involved, will suffice.
        For example, if a product uses a KEK to encrypt a Data Encryption Key
        (DEK), destroying the KEK using one of the methods in FCS_CKM_EXT.4 is sufficient, 
        since the DEK would no longer be usable (of course, presumes the DEK is still encrypted 
        and the KEK cannot be recovered or re-derived.).

              The evaluator shall test the generation-encryption and decryption-verification
              functionality of AES-CCM for the following input parameter and tag lengths: <h:ul>
                <h:li>128-bit (if selected) and 256-bit keys</h:li>
                <h:li>Two payload lengths. One payload length will be the shortest supported payload
                  length, greater than or equal to zero bytes. The other payload length will be the
                  longest supported payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits).

              either a FAIL result or a PASS result with the decrypted payload. The evaluator shall supply

		The TSF
              hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the
              byte-oriented mode. In this mode the TSF only hashes messages that
              are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length (in bits) of the message
              to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the bit-oriented mode. In this mode
              the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different
              tests for each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the
              bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented test MACs. The evaluator shall perform all of the

              The evaluator shall perform 15 trials for the RNG implementation. If the RNG
              is configurable, the evaluator shall perform 15 trials for each configuration. The
              evaluator shall also confirm that the operational guidance contains appropriate
              instructions for configuring the RNG functionality.
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      If the RNG has  prediction resistance enabled, each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2)
              generate the first block of random bits (3) generate a second block of random bits
              (4) uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is
              the expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each
              trial. The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and
              personalization string for the instantiate operation. The next two are additional
              input and entropy input for the first call to generate. The final two are

              are randomly generated. "generate one block of random bits" means to generate
              random bits with number of returned bits equal to the Output Block Length (as
              defined in NIST SP 800-90A).
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      If the RNG does not have prediction resistance,
              each trial consists of (1) instantiate DRBG, (2) generate the first block of

              uninstantiate. The evaluator verifies that the second block of random bits is the
              expected value. The evaluator shall generate eight input values for each trial.
              The first is a count (0 – 14). The next three are entropy input, nonce, and

                  personalization string length, then the same length can be used for both values.
                  If more than one string length is support, the evaluator shall use personalization
                  strings of two different lengths. If the implementation does not use a

	      The evaluator shall verify that the TSS section of the ST describes the
              routing of IP traffic when a VPN client is enabled.
	      The evaluator shall ensure that the description indicates which traffic does not go
              through the VPN and which traffic does, and that a configuration exists for each
              in which only the traffic identified by the ST author as necessary
              for establishing the VPN connection (IKE traffic and perhaps HTTPS or DNS traffic) is
              not encapsulated by the VPN protocol (IPsec).

		<step>The evaluator shall enable a network connection.
		  The evaluator shall sniff packets while performing running applications that use the network such as web browsers and email clients.
		  The evaluator shall verify that the sniffer captures the traffic generated by these actions, turn off the sniffing tool, and save the session data.
		  </step>
		  <step>
                  The evaluator shall configure an IPsec VPN client that supports the routing specified in this requirement.
		  The evaluator shall turn on the sniffing tool, establish the VPN connection, and perform the same actions with the device as performed in the first step.
		  The evaluator shall verify that the sniffing tool captures traffic generated by these actions, turn off the sniffing tool, and save the session data.
                  </step>
                  <step>
		  The evaluator shall examine the traffic from both step one and step two to verify that all non-excepted Data Plane traffic in Step 2 is encapsulated by IPsec.
		  The evaluator shall examine the Security Parameter Index (SPI) value present in the encapsulated packets captured in Step 2 from the TOE to the Gateway and will verify this value is the same for all actions used to generate traffic through the VPN.
		  Note that it is expected that the SPI value for packets from the Gateway to the TOE is different than the SPI value for packets from the TOE to the Gateway.
		  </step>
		  <step>
                  The evaluator shall perform a ping on the TOE host on the local network and verify that no packets sent are captured with the sniffer.
		  The evaluator shall attempt to send packets to the TOE outside the VPN tunnel (i.e. not through the VPN gateway), including from the local network, and verify that the TOE discards them.

The tests described must be performed in conjunction with the other certificate services evaluation activities, including the functions in FIA_X509_EXT.2.1.

<test> The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating a certificate without a valid certification path results in the function failing, for each of the following reasons, in turn:
by establishing a certificate path in which one of the issuing certificates is not a CA certificate,
by omitting the basicConstraints field in one of the issuing certificates,
by setting the basicConstraints field in an issuing certificate to have CA=False,
by omitting the CA signing bit of the key usage field in an issuing certificate, and
by setting the path length field of a valid CA field to a value strictly less than the certificate path.
The evaluator shall then establish a valid certificate path consisting of valid CA certificates, and demonstrate that the function succeeds.
The evaluator shall then remove trust in one of the CA certificates, and show that the function fails.
</test>
<test> The evaluator shall demonstrate that validating an expired certificate results in the function failing.</test>
<test> [Conditional, to be performed for use cases identified in exceptions that cannot be configured to allow revocation checking]
The evaluator shall test that the OS can properly handle revoked certificates - conditional on whether CRL, OCSP, OCSP stapling, or OCSP multi-stapling is selected; if multiple methods are selected, then a test will be performed for each method.
The evaluator shall test revocation of the node certificate and revocation of the intermediate CA certificate (i.e. the intermediate CA certificate should be revoked by the root CA).
If OCSP stapling per RFC 6066 is the only supported revocation method, testing revocation of the intermediate CA certificate is omitted.

              The bootchain of the OS is the sequence of software, to include the OS loader, the kernel, system
              drivers or modules, and system files, which ultimately result in loading the OS.
	          The first part of the OS, usually referred to as the first-stage bootloader,
	          must be loaded by the platform.
	          Assessing its integrity, while critical, is the platform's responsibility; and therefore outside
	          the scope of this PP. 
		      All software loaded after this stage is potentially within the control of the OS and is in scope.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
              The verification may be transitive in nature:
	      a hardware-protected public key, X.509 certificate, or hash may be used to verify the mutable bootloader code
              which contains a key, certificate, or hash used by the bootloader to verify the mutable OS kernel code,
              which contains a key, certificate, or hash to verify the next layer of executable code, and so on.
	      However, the way in which the hardware stores and protects these keys is out of scope.
	      </h:p>
	      <h:p>
              If all executable code (including bootloader(s), kernel, device drivers, pre-loaded applications, user-loaded

              be selected.

		If certificates are used, they can be hardware-protected trust store elements or leaf certificates in a certificate chain that terminates in a root CA which is an element of a hardware protected trust store.
		If the certificates themselves are not trust store elements, revocation information is expected to be available for each CA certificate in the chain that is not a trust element, in accordance with FIA_X509_EXT.1 as defined in the <xref to="pkg-x509"/>.

	This section lists the set of SARs from CC part 3

        Individual evaluation activities to be performed are specified both in

      The general model for evaluation of TOEs against STs written to conform to this PP is as follows:
      <h:br/>
      After the ST has been approved for evaluation, the ITSEF
      will obtain the OS, supporting environmental IT, and the administrative/user guides for
      the OS. The ITSEF is expected to perform actions mandated by the Common Evaluation
      Methodology (CEM) for the ASE and ALC SARs.
      The ITSEF also performs the evaluation activities contained within 
      <xref to="Security_Requirements"/>, which are intended to be an interpretation of the
      other CEM assurance requirements as they apply to the specific technology instantiated in the
      OS.
      The evaluation activities that are captured in 
      <xref to="Security_Requirements"/> also provide
      clarification as to what the developer needs to provide to demonstrate the OS is compliant
      with the PP.

          functional specification describes the TSFIs. It is not
          necessary to have a formal or complete specification of these interfaces. Additionally,
          because OSes conforming to this PP will necessarily have interfaces to
          the operational environment that are not directly invokable by OS
          users, there is little point specifying that such interfaces be described in and of
          themselves since only indirect testing of such interfaces may be possible. For this PP,
          the activities for this family should focus on understanding the interfaces presented in
          the TSS in response to the functional requirements and the interfaces
          presented in the AGD documentation. No additional "functional specification" documentation
          is necessary to satisfy the evaluation activities specified. The interfaces that need to be
          evaluated are characterized through the information needed to perform the assurance
          activities listed, rather than as an independent, abstract list.

              The following additional information is also required.
              If cryptographic functions are provided by the OS, the operational guidance ill contain instructions for configuring
              the cryptographic engine associated with the evaluated configuration of the OS.
              It will provide a warning to the administrator that use of other
              cryptographic engines was not evaluated nor tested during the CC evaluation of the
              OS.
              The documentation must describe the process for verifying
              updates to the OS by verifying a digital signature – this may be
              done by the OS or the underlying platform.
              The evaluator shall
              verify that this process includes the following steps: Instructions for obtaining the
              update itself.
              This should include instructions for making the update accessible to
              the OS (e.g., placement in a specific directory).
              Instructions for initiating the update process, as well as discerning whether the process was
              successful or unsuccessful.
              This includes generation of the hash/digital signature.
              The OS will likely contain security functionality that does not
              fall in the scope of evaluation under this PP.
              The operational guidance will make it

      <section id="ate" title="Class ATE: Tests">Testing is specified for functional aspects of
        the system as well as aspects that take advantage of design or implementation weaknesses.
        The former is done through the ATE_IND family, while the latter is through the AVA_VAN
        family. At the assurance level specified in this PP, testing is based on advertised
        functionality and interfaces with dependency on the availability of design information. One
        of the primary outputs of the evaluation process is the test report as specified in the
        following requirements.
	<a-component cc-id="ate_ind.1" name="Independent Testing - Conformance (ATE_IND.1)">
	  Testing is performed to confirm the
          functionality described in the TSS as well as the administrative
          (including configuration and operational) documentation provided. The focus of the testing
          is to confirm that the requirements specified in <xref to="SFRs"/> being met,
          although some additional testing is specified for SARs in
          <xref to="Security_Assurance_Requirements"/>. 
          The
          evaluation activities identify the additional testing activities associated with these
          components. The evaluator produces a test report documenting the plan for and results of
          testing, as well as coverage arguments focused on the platform/OS
          combinations that are claiming conformance to this PP.
	  Given the scope of the OS and its associated evaluation evidence requirements, this component's
          evaluation activities are covered by the evaluation activities listed for ALC_CMC.1.

		  The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system, including any application crashes during testing. The evaluator
              will determine the root cause of any application crashes and include that information
              in the report.
              The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in the <xref to="bibCEM"/>
              and the body of this PP's evaluation activities.
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform.
	      </h:p><h:p>
	      This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results.
	      </h:p><h:p>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This will be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a "fail" and "pass" result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the "pass" result.

  <appendix title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment" id="entropyappendix">
    <h:p>
      This appendix describes the required supplementary information for the entropy source used by the OS.
    </h:p>
    <h:p>
    The documentation of the entropy source should be detailed enough that, after reading, the
    evaluator shall thoroughly understand the entropy source and why it can be relied upon to provide
    sufficient entropy. This documentation should include multiple detailed sections: design
    description, entropy justification, operating conditions, and health testing. This documentation
    is not required to be part of the TSS.
    </h:p>
    <section id="entropydesign" title="Design Description">
      <h:p>
      Documentation will include the design of the entropy source as a whole, including the
      interaction of all entropy source components. Any information that can be shared regarding the
      design should also be included for any third-party entropy sources that are included in the
      product.
      </h:p>
      <h:p> The documentation will describe the operation of the entropy source to include,
      how entropy is produced, and how unprocessed (raw) data can be obtained from within the
      entropy source for testing purposes. The documentation should walk through the entropy source
      design indicating where the entropy comes from, where the entropy output is passed next, any
      post-processing of the raw outputs (hash, XOR, etc.), if/where it is stored, and finally, how
      it is output from the entropy source. Any conditions placed on the process (e.g., blocking)
      should also be described in the entropy source design. Diagrams and examples are encouraged.
      </h:p>
      <h:p> This design must also include a description of the content of the security boundary of
      the entropy source and a description of how the security boundary ensures that an adversary
      outside the boundary cannot affect the entropy rate.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>If implemented, the design
      description will include a description of how third-party applications can add entropy to the
      RBG. A description of any RBG state saving between power-off and power-on will be included.
      </h:p>
    </section>
    <section id="entropyjustification" title="Entropy Justification">
      <h:p>
      There should be a technical
      argument for where the unpredictability in the source comes from and why there is confidence
      in the entropy source delivering sufficient entropy for the uses made of the RBG output (by
      this particular OS). This argument will include a description of the expected min-entropy
      rate (i.e. the minimum entropy (in bits) per bit or byte of source data) and explain that
      sufficient entropy is going into the OS randomizer seeding process. This discussion will be
      part of a justification for why the entropy source can be relied upon to produce bits with
      entropy.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	The amount of information necessary to justify the expected min-entropy rate
	depends on the type of entropy source included in the product.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	For developer provided
      entropy sources, in order to justify the min-entropy rate, it is expected that a large number
      of raw source bits will be collected, statistical tests will be performed, and the min-entropy
      rate determined from the statistical tests. While no particular statistical tests are required
      at this time, it is expected that some testing is necessary in order to determine the amount
      of min-entropy in each output.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	For third-party provided entropy sources, in which the
      OS vendor has limited access to the design and raw entropy data of the source, the
      documentation will indicate an estimate of the amount of min-entropy obtained from this
      third-party source. It is acceptable for the vendor to "assume" an amount of min-entropy,
      however, this assumption must be clearly stated in the documentation provided. In particular,
      the min-entropy estimate must be specified and the assumption included in the ST.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	
      Regardless of type of entropy source, the justification will also include how the DRBG is
      initialized with the entropy stated in the ST, for example by verifying that the min-entropy
      rate is multiplied by the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG or that the rate of
      entropy expected based on the amount of source data is explicitly stated and compared to the
      statistical rate. If the amount of source data used to seed the DRBG is not clear or the
      calculated rate is not explicitly related to the seed, the documentation will not be
      considered complete.
      </h:p>
      <h:p>
	The entropy justification will not include any data added from any
	third-party application or from any state saving between restarts.
      </h:p>
    </section>
    <section id="entropyoperatingconditions" title="Operating Conditions"> The entropy rate may be
      affected by conditions outside the control of the entropy source itself. For example, voltage,
      frequency, temperature, and elapsed time after power-on are just a few of the factors that may
      affect the operation of the entropy source. As such, documentation will also include the range
      of operating conditions under which the entropy source is expected to generate random data. It
      will clearly describe the measures that have been taken in the system design to ensure the
      entropy source continues to operate under those conditions. Similarly, documentation will
      describe the conditions under which the entropy source is known to malfunction or become
      inconsistent. Methods used to detect failure or degradation of the source will be included. </section>
    <section id="entropyhealthtesting" title="Health Testing"> More specifically, all entropy source
      health tests and their rationale will be documented. This includes a description of the health
      tests, the rate and conditions under which each health test is performed (e.g., at start,
      continuously, or on-demand), the expected results for each health test, and rationale
      indicating why each test is believed to be appropriate for detecting one or more failures in
      the entropy source.
