		<!-- This section sets the context for not only the ESR, but what is 
			expected of the resulting Protection Profile (PP). The intent is 
			that the remaining sections provide succinct statements that 
			highlight the relevant aspects to be addressed by the Technical 
			Community (TC) constructing the PP. Here, the authors provide a 
			narrative that introduces the reader to the problem being solved, 
			and presents key aspects that support or guide the TC, and may
			elaborate on subtleties not apparent in the “bulleted” high level
			statements.

		An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and
		provides common services for application programs. The hardware it manages may be physical
		or virtual. <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p> This essential security requirements (ESR) document outlines the high-level
		security requirements for a general-purpose operating system (OS), which will be expressed
		in a Common Criteria Protection Profile (PP). These requirements address threats within a
		scope established by use cases and environment assumptions. In addition to stating what
		properties an OS must minimally exhibit, this document also identifies functionality that
		vendors should consider as extensions that go beyond the expected minimal baseline, and
		which may be appropriate in more-specific use cases. <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p> The security functionality must be
		realistic and achievable by commercially available products. The resulting PP will also
		include objective and repeatable evaluation activities, so that evaluations can be executed
		in a manner that tracks with industry's release of operating system products. <p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p> With
		regard to evaluation scope, the operating system itself is composed of the software that is
		delivered to the end user in the operating system product. This typically includes a kernel
		and drivers that run with elevated privileges, common software libraries, and a great deal
		of application software which runs with varying levels of privileges. Many of these
		applications provide security services and are an essential part of the operating system
		product. However, applications that are covered by more-specific Protection Profiles should
		not be evaluated as part of the OS evaluation, even when it is necessary to
		evaluate some of their functionality as it relates to their role as part of the OS. <div class="section" id="usecases">Use Cases</div>
		<!-- 
			This section is intended to provide the initial scope/bound of the 
			security problem by providing the reader with concise statements 
			regarding the scenarios in which the technology is being used. The 
			intended usage presented here should lay the groundwork for the 
			identifying the resources to be protected, and what threats must be
			considered in the drafting of the Essential Security Requirements 
			(ESR) and for the TC to consider when writing the PP.

		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> The OS is installed on a platform to allocate platform resources among applications.
			This includes several use cases in which the OS acts as a platform for applications: <ul>
				<li>End user systems such as a desktop or laptop, which is optionally bound to a
					directory server or management server</li>
				<li>Server systems, which run on physical or virtual hardware, and can run highly
					specialized configurations</li>
				<li>Cloud systems, end user or server systems running on physical or virtual
					hardware hosted in a data center</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Physical and logical resources managed by the OS (e.g. network interfaces,
					microphones, and storage media). </li>
				<li>Sensitive user data (e.g. home directories).</li>
				<li> Sensitive system data (e.g. account information, audit files, configuration
					files). </li>

	<div class="section" id="attackeraccess">Attacker access</div> The following assumptions are made about
		attackers' ability to develop attacks: <ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li> An attacker has an arbitrary amount of time to analyze the behavior of the OS, its
				interaction with its platform, and the data it transmits over the network. </li>
			<li> An attacker is able to acquire their own copy of the target OS and study its
				behavior on a platform that they control. </li>
		</ul>
		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"></p> The attacker is expected to engage in the following general classes of attack: <!-- added in order to allow for rather direct flow to Threats section in PP -->
		<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li> Network eavesdropping, in which an attacker may monitor and gain access to data
				exchanged between the OS and other endpoints. </li>
			<li> Network attack, in which an attacker may initiate malicious communications with the
				OS or alter communications between the OS and other endpoints. </li>
			<li> Local attack, in which an attacker has gained the ability to execute code on the
				system, which may be used to escalate privilege or access data without
				authorization. </li>
			<li> Limited physical access attack, in which an attacker may attempt to access data on
				the system by virtue of being physically present for a limited period of time. This
				limited physical access does not include attacks in which the attacker could
				disassemble the system to gain access to its storage media or manipulate the OS's
				underlying hardware and firmware. Systems used for working remotely, such as laptops
				and tablets, for which an attacker could gain longer physical access to, should
				apply additional protections that are provided by products evaluated against other
				Protection Profiles (e.g. FDE cPP). </li>
			<li> Persistence, in which an attacker has already exploited the system and wishes to
				maintain presence on the system. </li>

		<!--
        	This is where the authors present an initial set of English 
        	requirements that specify security functionality, rather than 
        	design and/or implementation characteristics. These requirements 
        	will provide the foundation for which the detailed set of 
        	requirements is derived. It is important that the requirements 
        	captured here make an attempt to fully address the categories 
        	(e.g., access control, identification and authentication, 
        	management capabilities, roles of administration, secure 
        	communications, and audit). That's not to say the requirements are 
        	fully specified or detailed enough to simply translate to Common 
        	Criteria security functional requirements. The goal is that there 
        	is enough information contained here, as well as the other sections
        	of this document, to provide the TC enough information to ensure 
        	they have an understanding of what is minimally required in breath.

		<p xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr"> The following are the essential security requirements expected to be implemented by an
			operating system within the established scope: <ul>
				<li> Implement modern anti-exploitation features, these include, but are not limited
					to Address Space Layer Randomization (ASLR), Stack Canaries/Cookies, and Data
					Execution Protection (DEP) to protect itself and its applications. </li>
				<li> Provide the following cryptographic services: <ul>
						<li>Asymmetric and Symmetric key generation</li>
						<li>Asymmetric and Symmetric encryption and decryption </li>

				<li> Provide strong authentication mechanisms. </li>
				<li> Leverage a trusted or secure boot process. </li>
				<li> Provide the ability to whitelist application execution. </li>

				<li> Audit security-relevant events and provide mechanism for secure transmission of

				<li> Provide mechanisms for management by the user and enterprise, to include
					optionally binding to: <ul>

		<!--
			Simply put, this section presents the aspects of the product and 
			its	intended environment that can be assumed to hold true. This 
			will provide additional scope on the resulting PP.
		-->
		The following assumptions are made for the operating system product and its operational
		environment: <ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>The underlying platform is physically protected, to a large extent. The hardware
				that the OS manages is secured by defensive measures that make physical attacks
				impractical for most attackers. At the same time, casual passersby might attempt to
				trivially access the system. </li>
			<li>The OS implements some security-relevant functionality that does not require
				evaluation (e.g., network time synchronization, process scheduling, and virtual
				memory management including process separation). </li>
			<li>Depending on configuration and capability, the OS may or may not be: <ul>
					<li>configuration-managed by the enterprise</li>
					<li>bound to directory services to support multi-user login</li> </ul>
			</li>
			<li> The OS runs application software developed by a third-party. The applications are
				not intentionally developed to be malicious, but can contain inadvertent coding
				errors. These errors introduce risk that control of an application may be seized by
				a malicious entity. The OS shall confine these applications within the originally
				designated operating environment. </li>
			<li>The platform is connected to a network. For purposes of sending/receiving data, to
				include software updates, the platform is connected to other entities. Other
				entities on the network are not inherently trustable. </li>
			<li>Administrators are not malicious in nature.</li>
			<li> Users are not malicious in nature, though they may inadvertently or intentionally engage in risky behavior. </li>
		</ul>
	<div class="section" id="extensions">Optional Extensions</div> 
		Additional security functionality that may
		be appropriate for some use cases, and can be expressed in extensions to this document,
		includes: 
		<ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>Multi-level Security (MLS) access controls</li>
			<li>Attestation of security measurements</li>
			<li>Data-at-rest protection - already covered in other PPs</li>
			<li>IPSec VPNs - already covered in other PPs</li>

		<!--
			This is where the authors explicitly state things they do not want 
			to be considered for inclusion in an evaluation against a 
			resulting PP.  Items expressed here could include threats, 
			functions or capabilities that would require assurance activities 
			that are too subjective, or specific expertise not available in the
			evaluation facilities expected to assess products against the PP 
			(e.g., assessing anti-tamper measures). 
		-->
		The following list contains items that are explicitly out-of-scope for any evaluation
		against the OS PP <ul xmlns="http://common-criteria.rhcloud.com/ns/esr">
			<li>Malicious, Highly-Privileged Administrators - Highly-privileged administrators
				acting maliciously can disable most, if not all, security protections on the OS.
				Additionally procedural controls that are out of scope of this document should be
				considered to help highlight administrator accounts acting suspiciously.</li>
			<li>Zero Days - The disclosure of recently published vulnerabilities (Zero Days) should
				not be used as a reason to fail an OS undergoing evaluation.</li>
			<li>Unofficial Versions - Non-vendor supplied install images often contain added
				functionality and may weaken the normal operating functionality of the OS</li>
			<li>Platform - The OS PP shall not address the hardware or firmware of its underlying
				platform to include the boot sequence before control is handed off to the OS. That
				the platform itself is virtual or physical is irrelevant to any evaluations. </li>
			<li>Applications - The OS PP shall not address applications that are not delivered as
				part of the OS installation process. </li>
