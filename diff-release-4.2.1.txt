        evaluator will sniff packets while performing running			      <
        applications that use the network such as web browsers and email	      <

        traffic generated by these actions, turn off the sniffing tool,		      <
        and save the session data.						      <
    -   **Step 2:** The evaluator will configure an IPsec VPN client		      <
        that supports the routing specified in this requirement. The		      <
        evaluator will turn on the sniffing tool, establish the VPN		      <
        connection, and perform the same actions with the device as		      <
        performed in the first step. The evaluator will verify that the		      <
        sniffing tool captures traffic generated by these actions, turn		      <
        off the sniffing tool, and save the session data.			      <
    -   **Step 3:** The evaluator will examine the traffic from both		      <
        step one and step two to verify that all non-excepted Data Plane	      <
        traffic in Step 2 is encapsulated by IPsec. The evaluator will		      <
        examine the Security Parameter Index (SPI) value present in the		      <
        encapsulated packets captured in Step 2 from the			      <

        from the Gateway to the [TOE](#abbr_TOE) is different than the		      <
        SPI value for packets from the [TOE](#abbr_TOE) to the Gateway.		      <
    -   **Step 4:** The evaluator will perform a ping on the			      <
        [TOE](#abbr_TOE) host on the local network and verify that no		      <
        packets sent are captured with the sniffer. The evaluator will		      <
